1. Write a program called `<coolfunction>` that takes in a number, and if it’s
even, adds 3 to it, if it’s odd multiply by 4 to it, and then print the resulting
number.
1. Create a program called `<vowel>` that reads a letter of the alphabet from the
user. If the user enters a, e, i, o or u then your program should display a
message indicating that the entered letter is a vowel. If the user enters y
then your program should display a message indicating that sometimes y
is a vowel, and sometimes y is a consonant. Otherwise, your program
should display a message indicating that the letter is a consonant.
1. Write a program called `<grader>` that takes in a user’s number grade and
outputs the user’s letter grade. Use the following scale:
- A = At least 90%
- B = At least 80% but less than 90%
- C = At least 70% but less than 80%
- D = At least 60% but less than 70%
