#Homework 6

##Instructions:
This homework has test cases. This means that after you’re done testing your own code to make sure it works, we have our own tests that you can use. 

If you’d like to use our test cases, for this assignment you’ll have to **name your file “hw3.py”.** Then, download and put our file “hw3-test.py” **in the same folder** as the hw3.py file. Run hw3_test.py. There's a blank example in this folder.

###Note: You need to make sure that you name your functions what we tell you to. 
###Other note: If you choose to do the challenge problem, you will have to un-comment the 

##Actual homework problems:

1. Write a function that takes in three numbers and returns the maximum of the three numbers. Name the function `<max>`. 
1. Challenge: Write a function that determines whether a number is prime. Name this function `<is_prime>`, and make it return either `<true>` or `<false>`.
